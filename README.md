# planet-simulation-pygame

It's a simulation of the first 4 planets of the solar system moving around the sun in an elliptical orbit. 
Made with Python and Pygame. 
The orbit and the distances are calculated with real values of constants like Astronomical unit, Gravitational constant and real masses and distances of planet to the sun. 

Essentially, the forces of attraction and velocities of each planet in the x and y direction are calculated relative to sun and each other. This is determined by the angle between the straight force and adjacent directional forces. 
It also made me revise some of the physics, fun project. Also reminds me how cool and capable Pygame actually is.
